<h3>Racket: Metaprogramming Time!</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 100px;" src="/storage/speakers/flatt.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358398784309" alt="" /></span></span>Racket is an extensible programming language: it allows programmers to define new syntactic forms and construct entirely new programming languages. While Racket inherits its basic approach to extensibility from Lisp and Scheme, Racket pushes extensibility into the realms of build management, documentation, testing, and the development environment. These frontiers require new language constructs both to create a time and place for everything and to keep everything in its time and place.</p>

<h3>Introducing Pedestal: Architecture and Services</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 75px;" src="/storage/speakers/brenton.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1361887870734" alt="" /></span></span>Pedestal is a set of libraries for building rich interactive Web applications using Clojure, ClojureScript and EDN. This talk starts with the big picture: problems Pedestal is designed to solve and the typical architecture of a Pedestal application. Then it dives into HTTP services, covering the details of the plumbing, including its relationship to Ring, and how they enable collaborative applications.</p>

<p>Brenton Ashworth is a developer at Relevance, Inc. He was involved in the development of ClojureScript, building some of its first tools, as well as working on the first ClojureScript application, TwitterBuzz. Since then, he created ClojureScript One, with the help of many people at Relevance, and has been building applications for clients which leverage Clojure from the database to the UI.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 75px;" src="/storage/speakers/Photo on 2011-01-13 at 15.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1362459344099" alt="" /></span></span>Tim Ewald is an architect and developer at Relevance, Inc, with more than 20 years experience building systems. He has used Clojure on a wide range of projects, including helping get the initial release of Datomic out the door. More recently, he's provided lead the effort to create Pedestal, a set of libraries for building web apps and services. Tim has also lead Relevance's Architecture Practice.</p>

<h3>Introducing Pedestal: Rich Client Applications</h3>
<p>This talk will build on part 1, starting with a statement of the problems faced when building large interactive applications in the browser. The talk will then show how the ideas behind Clojure can be used to solve these problems. Finally, it will introduce a model and tools for building applications which make them easier to build, test and reason about.</p>

<h3>Clojure and LLVM</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/baldridge.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358398530546" alt="" /></span></span>LLVM is a compiler toolkit for developing native languages. With companies from NVidia, to Apple pouring resources into this project, how can we leverage these libraries in Clojure?</p>
<p>In this talk, I will show my work writing a compiler in Clojure that uses LLVM for code generation. This project is known as clojure-py2. This from-the-ground re-write of clojure-py uses LLVM to create native (machine-code) Python extension modules on the fly. The resulting code is not only faster than python, but with proper type hints can approach the speed of ClojureScript and Clojure.</p>
<p>Running Clojure on Python opens up new areas to explore. Systems like the Raspberry Pi are often too memory constrained to run a JVM language. Python fills this gap by running closer to the metal, while also providing an extremely rich set of libraries to pull from.</p>

<h3>Functional Infrastructures: It's all fn until you hit production</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 75px;" src="/storage/speakers/batchelli.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358398833344" alt="" /></span></span>We Clojurians live a privileged life for most of our days: quick REPL prototyping, immutable data structures, abstractions, declarative statements, multi-methods, you name it, it's all fn!</p>
<p>But this fn stops when we are to deploy our beautifully crafted functional applications inside a larger infrastructure. Then it's all pain: setting up servers, installing the right versions of server software, updating configuration files... Ugh! No more quick REPL prototyping, abstractions, code reuse, declarative statements, immutability; all gone! It gets worse though. We now use platforms like Hadoop, HBase or Cassandra that require complex cross-node configurations. We have multiple developers wanting to test on different versions of the software and infrastructure. There are also many environments to deploy on: Integration, QA, Stage, Production, and There are different OS distros and versions to support, each with their own quirks and bugs. Oh!, and different hardware options too: cloud, virtualized, or even bare metal. You get the gist: a combinatorial explosion of complexity.</p>
<p>You say "Automate it with scripts!", but I say "Automation not enough!". "Scripts + database then!" you say... "Are you paying attention!?" Why should we develop in LISP-land but deploy Perl-land? Can't the same principles of functional programming make infrastructure automation as pleasant and productive as coding in Clojure? It is possible, and this talk is about what it takes to build and grow such stress-free Functional Infrastructures.</p>

<h3>Concatenative Clojure</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img style="width: 75px;" src="/storage/speakers/bloom.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399034665" alt="" /></span></span>It's said that if Lisp is the ultimate high-level language, then Forth is the ultimate low-level one. The Clojure community is on the cutting edge when it comes to embracing good ideas from the full-spectrum of programming paradigms. While core.logic looks up the spectrum to import good ideas from Logic Programming, Factjor looks down the spectrum to import good ideas from Concatenative and Stack-oriented Programming.</p>
<p>This talk begins with a brief history and background of concatenative programming and why it matters. Then, we'll take a whirlwind tour of the Factor language. Factor is to Forth what Clojure is to Common Lisp. The remainder of the talk will be a demonstration of Factjor, a concatenative programming DSL embedded in Clojure, and DomScript, a new Browser DOM manipulation library for ClojureScript that takes full advantage of the concatenative style.</p>

<h3>Core.logic and SQL Killed my ORM</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/brozefsky.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399099251" alt="" /></span></span>The relational programming model provided by core.logic frees developers from the impedance mismatch, and other limitations of Object Relational Mapping systems (ORMs).  This allows for massive gains in write speed and schema flexibility, avoids the rigidity of a single entity-relationship model and artifical notions like object identity, and greatly reduces the complexities of modeling time and change.</p>
<p>By extending core.logic defrel/fact we were able to define a set of relations that worked both with core.logic, and also mapped naturally to SQL tables.  A single data model was used to build our rule system for identifying malware behavior, as well as being the schema for our analysis and correlation database which is served up via a Clojure web app.</p>
<p>In this talk we will be presenting the tradeoffs involved with moving to a purely relational model, and ditching your ORM.  We will also introduce some of the tools we built to facilitate this.</p>

<h3>Beyond Contracts: An exploration into unified specifications</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/degrandis.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399131724" alt="" /></span></span>Clojure's rich interactive development encourages developers to explore a solution space while experimenting within a problem domain. But what if those explorations could be captured as tangible specifications, and used to automatically generate tests and documentation, be applied as contracts for functions, and even used in external verification systems?</p>
<p>This talk dives into such a system, illustrating the advantages of unifying core.contracts,  test.generative, and external systems under a single common specification, captured as a value.</p>
<p>Specification-as-a-value serves as a useful tool that guides developers through all phases of the software development lifecycle: from design to deployment.  A single specification could ensure your conceptual design is complete, that your functions conform to the design at runtime, and the functions pass an array of automatically generated tests.</p>

<h3><span>FRP in ClojureScript with Javelin</span></h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/dipert.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399215072" alt="" /></span></span>Functional Reactive programming (FRP) is a paradigm that holds great promise in the ClojureScript world as a way to mitigate the difficulty of modeling control flow and side effects in the browser. FRP techniques allow one to write "reactive" code in terms of dependency relations instead of in terms of callbacks or watches.</p>
<p>I'll introduce Javelin, a ClojureScript library, and demonstrate how it can be used to express a variety of asynchronous workflows in concise and composable ways.</p>
<p>Along the way, I&rsquo;ll compare FRP with spreadsheets, contrast FRP with Clojure's sequences, and cover some of the ideas, implementation techniques, and vocabulary common to many FRP libraries.</p>

<h3>Engines of Abstraction</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/duey.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399292972" alt="" /></span></span>"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.", a quote by Isaac Newton, succinctly expresses the art of programming. We build software on a foundation made with layers of abstractions that others have built.</p>
<p>This talk surveys several abstraction techniques that can help us build sound applications on the foundation of Clojure and highlights how we're already using specific examples of such abstractions in ad hoc fashion today.</p>

<h3>Ritz - the missing Clojure tooling</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/duncan.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399339477" alt="" /></span></span>Developing in clojure is fun, and enables you to get into that productive flow state.  That is until you hit that tricky bug, and start peppering your code with println statements when a debugger might be easier.  Or you trigger one of those compilation errors where clojure doesn't give you a source location.  Or when you need to add a new library to your project, and you don't want to restart your REPL.  Or maybe you'ld like to see how the function you're editing has changed over time.</p>
<p>Ritz is a set of tools for debugging, inspecting, project reloading, codeq integration, lein integration, etc, for both nrepl and swank based tooling. This talk will show how ritz can be used with nrepl.el in emacs.</p>

<p>We'll take a look at Friend's overall design and how you can use it to model and implement authentication and authorization for your app within the Ring tradition.  We'll also go beyond well-worn paths like interactive form login and role-based authorization to see how Friend may be extended to implement things like multi-factor authentication, phishing prevention, and arbitrary authorization schemes.</p>

<h3>Macros: Why, When, and How</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/fredericks.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399426735" alt="" /></span></span>Macros are the classic meta-feature of lisps, enabling the implementation of nearly anything imaginable. On the other hand they're frequently overused and their overuse is frequently complained about. Against all good judgment, we will give an intuitive account of what macros are, how they work, and how to analyze their behavior; give advice for when to use them or avoid them, and how to write good ones when you need to; and show off some of the wilder possibilities.</p>

<h3>PuppetDB: Sneaking Clojure into Sysadmins' Toolkits</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/giridharagopal.png?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399472640" alt="" /></span></span>Puppet is the most widely deployed open-source configuration management tool on the planet, written in Ruby. As deployments got bigger, people began demanding more of Puppet: store more data, store it more reliably, store it more quickly, and give us better ways to access it.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href="http://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb">PuppetDB</a> was born. It's an open-source, centralized storage system for Puppet users; it persists object graphs, key-value data, and time-series logging information. Ruby wouldn't cut it for us. Written in Clojure, it features a bespoke query language and compiler, exploits and embeds a wide variety of JVM libraries such as ActiveMQ and Jetty, uses a whole ton of Clojure libraries for things ranging from cheshire to ring to clojureql to slingshot and so on.</p>
<p>In this talk we'll discuss a few major topics: what PuppetDB does and how it does it, the experience of bringing Clojure to a Ruby shop (comparing and contrasting the toolchains), and things we learned from having thousands of non-developers consuming our Clojure code.</p>

<h3>Piplin &ndash; A DSL for describing silicon in Clojure</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/greenberg.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399636137" alt="" /></span></span>Designing hardware is a fascinating and frustrating procress&ndash;the virtually unlimited parallelism and customizability are often outweighed by the simple, relatively inexpressive languages would-be hardware programmers must use. Piplin is an open-source DSL that allows a subset of Clojure to be automatically converted into a hardware description, which can then be placed onto an FPGA or made into a silicon chip.</p>
<p>Piplin has several interesting features: it provides polymorphic implementation of the standard Clojure library, along with a flow-typing and inference system that allows for libraries to define new numeric and structural types. Piplin also takes an atypical approach to embedding&ndash;it can actually produce hardware descriptions or Clojure functions without any performance penalty due to an innovative internal representation.</p>
<p>This talk will discuss the design of Piplin, focusing on how it leverages Clojure's polymorphic capabilities to provide an extremely flexible system for simulating and synthesizing hardware modules in Clojure.</p>

<h3>Global Forest Watch: an open source Clojure project to monitor deforestation from satellite imagery</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/hammer.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358399699902" alt="" /></span></span>Deforestation accounts for 15% of annual greenhouse gas emissions, more than the entire global transportation sector.  We will all die if carbon emissions continue apace.  Any viable effort to curb the rate of deforestation depends on open and transparent monitoring of forest clearing activity.</p>
<p>We have developed an algorithm to parse terabytes of NASA satellite imagery toward a tractable estimate of deforestation at 500-meter resolution, updated every 16 days.  The algorithm is now the basis for Global Forest Watch, which will be released in April 2013 by the World Resources Institute.</p>

<h3>Introducing ClojureScript-in-ClojureScript</h3>

The current ClojureScript compiler leverages the regular Clojure compiler for much of the heavy lifting. ClojureScript-in-ClojureScript (cljs-in-cljs) is a port of ClojureScript (including the Clojure top-half and other JVM specific code) entirely to ClojureScript.</p>
<p>This talk will describe the process of creating cljs-in-cljs and the missing pieces that had to be ported or created from scratch.  I will walk through the read/analyze/emit/eval process for several common Clojure forms and describe the difference in handling between the three compilers (Clojure, Cljs, cljs-in-cljs). Along the way I will discuss some of the deep dark magic at the heart of both the Clojure and ClojureScript compilers (namely vars and namespaces) and I will describe the alternate solutions I used for cljs-in-cljs.</p>
<p>I will also demonstrate the cljs-in-cljs port in action and give an idea of where and why it is useful. Finally I will discuss where I would like to see cljs-in-cljs go in the future and what it will take to merge it upstream.</p>

Much as Douglas Adams produced "The Hitchhicker's Guide" material in multiple forms, a Clojure programmer can assign data-readers to process tagged literals with customized implementations. Clojure 1.5 adds a new feature that makes dealing with unknown tags simple and convenient. We'll also talk about the Extensible Data Notation (EDN), which aims to be the Babel fish of data transfer. Finally, we will explore a few unorthodox uses for data-readers.</p>

<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/rathore.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400133822" alt="" /></span></span>For a lot of us, Clojure is very different from anything we&rsquo;ve used before. The syntax is different, the functional paradigm is different, multimethods are new, the macro system is alien, immutability, side-effects, mutating state, protocols, data-types, reify... oh my!</p>
<p>Even after understanding the basics of the language, there&rsquo;s often uncertainty about how to go about writing programs. How to structure applications? What goes where? What kind of layers? What about I/O? What&rsquo;s the scene with TDD? Mocking or stubbing? What about distributed computation? How to organize namespaces? What&rsquo;s this bottom-up thing? Composition? Meta-linguistic abstraction? Really?</p>
<p>This talk is drawn from multiple large-scale Clojure systems, across nearly 5 years of real-world Clojure usage. You&rsquo;ll see how to get started with designing non-trivial applications, how to ensure the code communicates to anyone reading it, and how to ensure you can grow the code-base and the team, with some level of sanity.</p>

<h3>clojure-scheme: Compiling Clojure to Native Code via Scheme</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/sorenson.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400234948" alt="" /></span></span>Clojure's targeting of the JVM makes a vast array of libraries readily available. However, this dependency puts certain platforms, such as iOS mobile devices, out of reach. With the advent of cross-compilation approaches such as ClojureScript, these limitations are starting to lessen. This talk will focus on clojure-scheme, a recent fork of the ClojureScript compiler that translates Clojure code to Scheme code. In combination with the mature and robust Gambit Scheme compiler, it now becomes possible to compile this Schemified Clojure code to raw C. This talk will show how to use this trick to perform stunning feats never seen before, such as creating tiny and efficient executables or running Clojure code natively on iOS with full access to Objective-C libraries. We will also look behind the curtain and see the semantic similarities between Scheme and Clojure that make this technique straightforward, as well as the differences that pose more difficulty.</p>

<p>Sadly, though, he could do little about the preexisting APIs, which embody none of those principles. The DOM and its equally vile cousins are all stubbornly object oriented, referentially opaque, and for the most part splendid examples of how not to design clean and friendly APIs.</p>

<h3>Metaprogramming Polyfill: Feed Clojure Data to your JavaScript Libraries</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/white.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400327956" alt="" /></span></span>We should make it as easy as possible to use JavaScript libraries idiomatically from ClojureScript. While ClojureScript functions and JavaScript functions are wonderfully interchangeable, the same is not true for idiomatic Clojure and JavaScript data structures. The impedance mismatch can be found as data translation points sprinkled through the code, and are often spelled clj-&gt;js and js-&gt;clj. What a shame that after we data all things, we find we have to make an explicit runtime copies back and forth for our JavaScript friends.</p>
<p>In many cases it turns out that this data translation is unnecessary. By adding some JavaScript metaprogramming to ClojureScript prototypes, we can polyfill JavaScript libraries so that they can natively use ClojureScript collection classes. With just a wee bit of hackery, a JavaScript library will think that all ClojureScript seqs are JavaScript arrays and all ClojureScript maps are JavaScript objects. Tom will show examples of using this technique to write idiomatic ClojureScript code that uses the d3.js dynamic graphing library.</p>

<h3>Intro to CLP with core.logic</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/senior.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400397512" alt="" /></span></span>Traditional logic programming allows only a single constraint via equality. Until recently, this was the only option in core.logic. Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) allows the user to declare more specific information about the possible values of a variable. A variable could be declared as a number in a specific range, for example. This goes beyond a basic equality check and allows for efficient higher level operations, such as arithmetic. With features inspired by cKanren, core.logic now has support for CLP. This opens up another large set of problems that core.logic can help solve efficiently. This talk will introduce CLP using core.logic through examples and live coding. The coding and examples will build to some logic puzzles and give attendees the essential background to have some fun with core.logic and CLP.</p>

<h3>core.logic.nominal</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/admin.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400717398" alt="" /></span></span>Nominal logic simplifies reasoning about scope and binding, so that implementing interpreters and type inferencers is almost as easy as on paper. Inspired by alphaKanren, we embed nominal logic programming into Clojure. Unlike alphaKanren, which is incompatible with cKanren, core.logic.nominal extends core.logic. In this talk, I will introduce the core.logic.nominal primitives (fresh, tie, hash), show some examples (quine generator, typed lambda calculus, theorem prover) and highlight our implementation.</p>

<h3>Logic programming in the wild</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/pickard.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400430525" alt="" /></span></span>Logic programming may be powerful, but it is hard to apply. Even experienced developers get tripped up by unwelcome surprises time and again. Accordingly, hardly any real software gets written in Prolog -- and many who do work with logic programming focus on very clever (but at times contrived) toy problems.</p>
<p>miniKanren and kin are an exciting development because they integrate well with their functional host language and get many things right, promising to get more actual work done. Nevertheless I believe there still is room for development.</p>
<p>In my talk I will focus on LP in two core areas that should matter strongly to working software developers: metaprogramming and data access (both in a wide sense). I will outline the potential LP has in these areas and study some major roadblocks to realizing this potential, with respect to formalisms and cognitive load.</p>
<p>We will proceed to take apart the core components of logic programming and look at ways to reassemble them with more leverage. Using that leverage we can introduce features to guide and assist developers avoiding everyday LP madness. I will provide a survey of new and well-known techniques to deal with some of the most pressing usability issues in logic programming.</p>
<p>I might claim that LP language designers have yet been neither crazy and nor considerate enough to both sufficiently empower and shield users and victims of logic programming in the wild.</p>

<h3>Molog: Typed Functional Logic Programming in Haskell</h3>
<p><span class="full-image-float-right ssNonEditable"><span><img src="/storage/speakers/foltzer.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1358400671657" alt="" /></span></span>Molog is an experimental derivative of miniKanren embedded in Haskell, designed to bring to bear the power of Haskell's type system on logic programs. In this talk, I will show Molog versions of familiar examples, give an overview of the distinction between relational and functional logic programs, describe how Molog's core persistent heap monad enables optimizations like path compression, and survey the challenges and benefits of insisting on strong types for a logic programming language.</p>

Rx extends the observer pattern to support sequences of data/events and adds operators for composing sequences together declaratively while abstracting away low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety, concurrent data structures, non-blocking IO and other such concerns.
